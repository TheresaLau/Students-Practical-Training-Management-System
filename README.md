# Students-Practical-Training-Management-System
This is a web project using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. It is my year 2 project for the web programming subject, which I am working on with my teammates. There will be three roles: Coordinator, Student, and Admin.

This project will work on localhost, which requires the installation of XAMPP and starting the Apache and MySQL servers. Move this file to xampp/htdocs and run localhost/(folder's name) in any browser.
